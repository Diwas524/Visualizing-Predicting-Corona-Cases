# Corona-Visualization-Forecasting

From World Health Organization – On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. Since then Corona Virus is spreading across the globe. In this project ” VISUALIZING & PREDICTING CORONA CASES”, we will be using a dataset from Our World in Data.

Here we will be visualizing the current trend of cases and trends in Asia, especially in Nepal(You can choose your own country). So, let’s begin the project by importing the dataset & other libraries.

# VISUALIZING CASES IN ASIA REGION

Here, we are visualizing the corona datasets only from Asia. So, we will be selecting datasets related to the Asia continent only. We will be grouping the datasets by country name i.e location and date. Now, we will visualize the cureent corona cases in the Asia region as of October 13.

As the corona cases in India is too large comparing with other countries, we couldn’t visualize the corona cases in all countries of Asia. So, we will be removing India from the list and will visualize again.
